# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The main purpose of this project was to get some experience using JavaScript, HTML and CSS using the REACT.JS frameworks. I have taken inspirations from such resources and have followed these tutorials as a starting point and a way to understand javascript a bit more:

and other repos online. I also took this project as opportunity to learn how to utilize ChatGPT as a tool to help me get up to speed with a language and see its abilities to solve issues I came accross and understand my wants and needs when it came to what I wanted to build. I also used it as opportunity to see the ability of ChatGPT where initially I was putting in the whole code, especially when came a across an issue. this proved to be a problem as it made to over reliant on the ability of the AI and prevented me from utilizing my brain. I slowly  realized this and began to do things differently rather than copy and paste the entire code, I would try to ask it questions on concept I didn't understand so that I could get a better understanding. But it was a google lesson  to not be over reliant on it and use it as a tool instead of an alternative to my brain. Overall this was a good experience and helped me understand the basics of javascript, html and css using react js. But I didn't not include this on my resume since I feel it wasn't entirely my own work but it was a good experience to help me learn about JS, html, css and react.js.

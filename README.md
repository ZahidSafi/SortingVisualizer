# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The main purpose of this project was to get some experience using JavaScript, HTML and CSS using the REACT.JS frameworks. I have taken inspirations from such resources:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc&t=385s
and other repos online. I also took this project as opportunity to learn how to utilize ChatGPT as a tool to help me get up to speed with a lanuage and see its abilities to solve issues I came accross and understand my wants and needs when it came to what I wanted to build. Overall this was a good experience and helped me understand the basics of javascript, html and css using react js.
